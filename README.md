# Counterfactual Bounds for Algorithmic Recourse 

### Objective

In causal settings, our approach aims to find the *informative* bounds for every action (in the form of atomic interventions) and suggests whether recourse will 'flip' the decision of an individual

### HOW TO:

Input : {Data, edges, latent_edges, type_of_actions}

Output : {For every action *a*, we get lower bound(LB) and upper bound (UB)}
